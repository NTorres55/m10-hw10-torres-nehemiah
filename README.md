## Problems I had 
1. This week I felt rushed and it was my fault. I gave up alot sooner on trying to solve my problems (even though it is late) and had trougle with the 4th section of the assignment.
2. I had issues installing Babel and transpiling. Everthing looked okay, except for the 4th part, until I tried to transpile - then everthing disappeared. I couldn't correct the issue after trying to troubleshoot for a bit and was unsuccessful.
